# Hospital-Management-Dashboard-Power-BI-Project
A hospital management dashboard built in Power BI that visualizes patient admissions, discharges, follow-ups, billing, insurance coverage, bed occupancy, diagnostics, and doctor feedback. Designed to help monitor and improve hospital performance using interactive visual analytics.

## Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard is designed from the inpiration of a youtube tutorial of the channel named 'Top Varsity' to provide a comprehensive and interactive visualization of hospital management data. It helps in monitoring patient activity, hospital performance, and key healthcare metrics through visual storytelling. The project uses patient-level data to derive insights related to admission trends, discharge follow-ups, billing, insurance claims, medical tests, doctor feedback, and more.


##  Dataset Features

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **Patient ID** â€“ Unique identifier for each patient  
- **Admit Date** â€“ The date a patient was admitted  
- **Discharge Date** â€“ The date a patient was discharged
